          <p class="heading-paragraph-text">The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at
            providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when
            their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).
            The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

            Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).
